    <h2>About Three Days Grace</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Three Days Grace</strong> is a Canadian rock band formed 
        in Norwood, Ontario, in 1992 originally as <strong>Groundswell</strong>. 
        <strong>Groundswell</strong> played in various local Norwood backyard parties 
        and area establishments before disbanding in 1995 and regrouping in 1997 under 
        its current name. 
        
        <br>Based in Toronto, the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead 
        vocalist <strong>Adam Gontier</strong>, drummer and backing vocalist <strong>Neil Sanderson</strong>, 
        and bassist <strong>Brad Walst</strong>. In 2003, <strong>Barry Stock</strong> was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, 
        making them a quartet. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by Walst's younger brother <strong>Matt Walst</strong>, who 
        was previously the lead singer of <em>My Darkest Days.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Why I love Three Days Grace</h2>

    <p>Three Days Grace is a rock band that I grew up loving due to their deep lyrics mixed with a strong bass, which makes their music enoyable to listen to. Their music is catchy, deep, and has great instrumentals which is exactly what I like in a rock band.
